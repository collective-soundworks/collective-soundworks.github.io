## Development

`soundworks` has been initiated by [Norbert Schnell](https://github.com/NorbertSchnell), [Sébastien Robaszkiewicz](https://github.com/i-Robi), and [Benjamin Matuszewski](https://github.com/b-ma) at the [ISMM](http://ismm.ircam.fr/) team at [Ircam - Centre Pompidou](http://www.ircam.fr/) in the context of the [CoSiMa](http://cosima.ircam.fr/) research project founded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

Development is now led by Benjamin Matuszewski, in the [Sound Music Movement Interaction Team](https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/interaction-son-musique-mouvement/) from the Ircam's STMS-LAB.
