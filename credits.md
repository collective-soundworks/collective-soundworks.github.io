## Design & Development

`soundworks` has been initiated by [Norbert Schnell](https://github.com/NorbertSchnell), [Sébastien Robaszkiewicz](https://github.com/i-Robi), and [Benjamin Matuszewski](https://github.com/b-ma) at the [ISMM](http://ismm.ircam.fr/) team at [Ircam - Centre Pompidou](http://www.ircam.fr/) in the context of the [CoSiMa](http://cosima.ircam.fr/) research project founded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

Development is now led by Benjamin Matuszewski, in the [Sound Music Movement Interaction Team](https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/interaction-son-musique-mouvement/) from the Ircam's STMS-LAB.

## Supporting Research Projects

Initial and futher developments has been supported by the following research projects:

- The [DOTS](http://dots.ircam.fr/) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR)
- The Ircam projects _BeCoMe_ and _SO(a)P_
- The _Constella(c)tions_ residency, funded by the STARTS program of the European Commission
- The [RAPID-MIX project](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program
- The [CoSiMa](http://cosima.ircam.fr/) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR)

## Artistic & Research  Collaborations

The design & development of `soundworks` has also been conducted within many collaborations with composers, artists, designers and researchers.

A number of musical pieces and artworks created using `soundworks` can be found on the Ircam - Sound Music Movement Interaction team YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/ircam-ismm](https://www.youtube.com/ircam-ismm).

Some generic applications are also accessible online at [https://apps.ismm.ircam.fr](https://apps.ismm.ircam.fr).
